A 3D Rendering of the Louisville, CO Sweet Cow Ice Cream shop

Important keys (full key bindings towards bottom):
-'o' or 'O' opens the door to the shop
-You can hit 'b' or 'B' at any time to jump to the freezer where buckets of
ice cream are stored.
- ' ' (spacebar) toggles shadows on and off.
- a,s,w,d for first person movement

Important notes:
1. This is a project I'm extremely proud of. My friends, family, co-workers,
and boss are all very impressed.
2. Something that took me a very long time was the cake freezer, straight ahead
in first person view towards the back wall.
3. Shadows also took me a very long time. I have chosen to keep the light
movement in the NULL position.
4. I have a cylinder with an angled slice cut out of it on the handrail also
straight ahead from the door. I have a quarter cylinder on the dip cabinets (the
white cubes with the silver tops). I did a lot of edits to the original cylinder
and cube functions to allow for different textures in different places. There
are numerous cases with needing only one side textured vs all sides.
5. The scene starts off in first person mode. Hitting 'f' sends you to
perspective mode, and m can put you in orthogonal mode.
6. The seemingly random hallway is supposed to be there, it connects to a
restaurant in the real shop.
7. I unfortunately ran out of time, but I would've liked to add shelves and
photos to some of the wall to emulate the shop.
